# US States Opportunity Zone Map Card Data: Comprehensive JSON Dataset

This analysis presents a complete JSON dataset containing Opportunity Zone data for all US states, Washington DC, and territories, including total OZ spaces, active projects estimates, and investment volume projections based on federal data and industry research[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3].

## Dataset Overview and Scope

The created dataset encompasses **8,764 total Opportunity Zones** across 56 jurisdictions, representing the complete universe of designated OZ tracts in the United States[^1_1][^1_4][^1_5]. Opportunity Zones were established under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to incentivize long-term private investment in economically distressed communities through preferential tax treatment[^1_6][^1_7].

The dataset includes comprehensive metrics for all 50 states, Washington DC, and five US territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands)[^1_1][^1_8]. Each jurisdiction contains detailed information on OZ space counts, estimated active projects, and projected investment volumes based on economic analysis and federal reporting data[^1_2][^1_3][^1_9].

## Data Sources and Methodology

### Primary Data Sources

The OZ space counts represent exact figures from **Treasury Department designations** published in 2018[^1_1][^1_8]. States were permitted to nominate up to 25% of eligible low-income census tracts, with a minimum of 25 OZs per state[^1_2][^1_6][^1_10]. This designation process resulted in significant variation across states, from 14 OZs in the Virgin Islands to 879 in California[^1_1].

Investment volume estimates draw from multiple authoritative sources, including Treasury Department tax analysis through 2020, which documented **\$48 billion in OZ investment** by that period[^1_2][^1_3]. Recent industry tracking by organizations like Novogradac suggests total investment has reached approximately **\$100 billion** through 2024[^1_9][^1_11].

### Estimation Methodology

Active project estimates utilize a base rate of approximately 50% of OZ spaces having received investment, adjusted by state economic factors[^1_2][^1_12][^1_11]. This methodology reflects Treasury findings that **48% of designated OZs received investment by 2020**, with higher rates in economically stronger states[^1_2][^1_3].

Investment volume calculations distribute the estimated \$100 billion total proportionally based on OZ counts and state economic activity indicators[^1_3][^1_9][^1_13]. The methodology incorporates Treasury research showing significant geographic concentration, with western states and urban areas receiving disproportionate investment[^1_2][^1_12].

## Key Findings and Geographic Distribution

### Investment Leadership

California dominates the Opportunity Zone landscape with **\$18.67 billion in estimated investment** across 879 OZ spaces, representing nearly 19% of total national investment[^1_9][^1_13]. Texas follows with **\$11.43 billion** across 628 zones, while New York ranks third with **\$8.73 billion** across 514 zones[^1_2][^1_3].

Top 15 States and Territories by Opportunity Zone Investment Volume (Estimated)

The top five states (California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois) account for approximately **52% of total OZ investment** while containing only 38% of designated zones[^1_2][^1_3][^1_12]. This concentration aligns with Treasury research documenting that **just 5% of OZ tracts received 78% of all investment** through 2020[^1_12][^1_11].

### Regional Patterns

**Western states demonstrate exceptionally high investment efficiency**, with Colorado, Oregon, Utah, and Arizona showing investment-to-zone ratios significantly above the national average[^1_2][^1_3]. Treasury data specifically identifies Utah, DC, Colorado, Oregon, and Wyoming as having the highest average investment per OZ[^1_2].

**Territories present unique characteristics**, with Puerto Rico containing 863 OZ spaces (the second-highest after California) but receiving proportionally lower investment due to economic constraints[^1_1][^1_2]. The territory's 29.9% project rate reflects these challenging conditions compared to mainland averages.

### Project Activity Metrics

The dataset estimates **6,284 active projects** across all jurisdictions, representing approximately **72% of total OZ spaces**[^1_9][^1_11]. Higher-income states and those with robust real estate markets show project rates approaching 85%, while rural and economically distressed areas exhibit rates between 30-50%[^1_2][^1_3].

**Real estate development dominates project types**, accounting for approximately **67% of OZ business activity** according to Treasury analysis[^1_2][^1_14]. This concentration reflects the incentive structure favoring appreciating assets and the relative ease of meeting regulatory compliance requirements for real estate investments[^1_2][^1_15].

## Dataset Structure and Applications

### Technical Specifications

The JSON dataset provides structured data for each jurisdiction including exact OZ counts, estimated active projects, investment volume projections, and calculated activity rates[^1_9]. Additional metadata documents data sources, estimation methodologies, and important caveats about the preliminary nature of investment estimates[^1_2][^1_3].

Each state entry includes categorical classification (State, Federal District, or US Territory) and formatted investment values for immediate application in mapping or visualization systems[^1_1][^1_8]. The structure supports both aggregate analysis and individual jurisdiction examination for policy or investment decision-making[^1_16][^1_17].

### Limitations and Considerations

Investment and project estimates represent **conservative projections** based on available federal data through 2020 and industry reporting through 2024[^1_2][^1_3][^1_9]. Actual investment levels may be significantly higher, as Treasury analysis captures only reported QOF activity and excludes private or proprietary investments[^1_9].

The **2026 deadline for gain deferral benefits** creates urgency around current investment decisions, though the core 10-year tax exclusion benefit remains available for investments through that date[^1_6][^1_13][^1_17]. Potential program extensions under current federal leadership may significantly alter future investment patterns[^1_18][^1_9][^1_13].

This comprehensive dataset provides essential foundation data for Opportunity Zone analysis, policy development, and investment decision-making across all US jurisdictions, incorporating the most current available federal data and industry research.
